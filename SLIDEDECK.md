101. splash

102. 3 main points about awesomeness; butterfly model:

		- a picture of a user,
		 Maybe with a vr/ar thing
		 And an interface
		 Looking at a enter
		 Maybe a real world they are looking at
		 Maybe a digital copy they see

		- a center
		- an “idea” of a computational soup
		- lightweight distributed easy to re-org
		- social creative live programming
		- distributed over computers
		- applications built out of components
		- fine grained security
		- hypervisor
		- local device / remote device
		- large datasets
		- high level semantic intent messages

		- a concrete formalization of the idea
		- wasm
		- scripting language
		- visual language
		- 


103. problems with current affairs
		- basically it is hard to build apps
		- hard to wire apps together
		- models are incredibly archaic
		- totally frustrating; frozen in time, built around ancient patterns, harddrives and so on

		- look at unity, unreal, app store build process, horrible, oculus store
		- steamvr

		- npm other package managers, late binding -> hint at a future


104. blue sky vision
	- vr
	- ar
	- sense making
	- synthesis
	- fairness
	- personal agency
	- durable persistence
	- robots
	- 3d views
	- computational soups


		- zero thinking about granular sanxboxing
		- just in time delivery
		- real time creative coding
		- durable persistence
		- synthesis of views

105. Growing ecosystem of tools

	- rust
	- wasm
	- tensorflow
	- openxr
	- quest
	- hololens

106.
		- example users
			- farmbot
			- creative coding
			- personal cv

107.
		- example apps -> maybe combine with users
			- cv app
			- multiplayer world app
			- simple creative demos


108. the whole picture

		- future oriented browser
			- different kinds of consumer needs -> A PICTURE OF A PERSON IN AR
			- digital soup futures, lightweight, distributed, easy to reorg, over multiple computers
			- just in time apps built from pieces, durable, background, synthesis, secure
			- personal computing: personal agency, creative / live / social programming
			- secure
			- packaging
			- computer vision

109. measuring success

		- measuring success
			- can users wire together their own apps?
			- 




200. parts

		- "services", both built in and dynamic; separate threads, can only send/recv messages
		- a package manager for services; fetch over the net, store, load, start, stop, wire together, set security policy
		- apps as a collection of services / components or parts
		- security policy between parts not around apps
		- messaging bus between parts
		- manifests for describing apps, services, security and messaging
		- directed acyclic graph / filesystem like philosophy for organizing services
		- hypervisor for load balancing services
		- semantic intent to broker traffic between parts
		- metagrammar to help express work
		- display engine using a dom like retained state graph, allows synthetic views of multiple apps
		- vision model using a dom like retained mode state graph

201. bootstrap

202. event system

203. feature matrix competitive




300. governance

	- governance
		- dao
		- fairness, stakeholders, transparency and so on

301. timeline

302. team
